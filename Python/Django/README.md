# Welcome to the Django Notes

Below you will find a step by step walk through of getting a django project started and running!

## Getting Started

1. Create a directory for your project, for this example we will use the following command:
`mkdir todo-list`

2. Run `pip install django`

3. Run `django-admin startproject mysitenamehere`

4. Test if it worked by changing directories to the mysitenamehere directory:
`cd mysitenamehere`

5. Test if the program is working by running the following:
`python manage.py runserver`

6. Navigate to localhost:8000 and ensure everything worked!
