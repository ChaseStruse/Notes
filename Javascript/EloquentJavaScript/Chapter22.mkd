# Chapter 22 JavaScript and Performance

- In the past JavaScript was so slow it was a reason to switch, that is not as much of the case now
- Modern Compilers compile and load JS files about 10% as fast as C programs
  - Not bad for a scripting language that used to be < 1%
- JavaScript is compiled over and over even as the program is running
