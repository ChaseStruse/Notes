# Chapter 9 Regular Expressions (Regex)

- Creating a regular expression
  - let regex = new RegExp("abc");
  - let regex = /abc/;

- Test for matches
  - console.log(/abc/.test("abcde"));
    - Returns: True
  - console.log(/abc/.test("xyz"))
    - Returns: False

This was a chapter that didn't feel like it warranted having a lot of notes over.
Due to Regular Expressions being rare if you need to use Regex I'd refer back to the chapter.
