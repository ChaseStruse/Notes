# Chapter 10 Modules

- Modules are great for keeping your code clean
- They help with ensuring you do not end up with a "big ball of mud"
- Module dependency is something to watch out for
- Packages are hosted in npm
- 'require' ensures that the program includes the required package
- Rather than 'using' like in C# you use 'import'
- You can also export functions, commonly seen in react
