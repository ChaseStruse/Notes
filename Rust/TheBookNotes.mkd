## Getting Started

Anatomy of a Rust Program <br />
<br />
`fn main() {
            
}`           <br />

main functions are important due to them being the first function that gets run in a rust program. <br />
Rust requires {} and functions are defined with fn <br />
`println!("Hello, world!");` // This is how you print to the console in rust <br />
