# How should a React project be structured?

Disclaimer: This is a living document and will change as I grow as a developer or at least it should...

## Components
-src</br>
--Components</br>
---Component Name</br>
----Component.js</br>
----ComponentStyle.css</br>
---Component Name 2</br>
----Component.js</br>
----ComponentStyle.css</br>

To me this seems to make sense, its easy to read and easy to locate.
