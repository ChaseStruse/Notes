# Day One

For day one I primarily focused my attention on AWS and Python, I will be starting a new job in May and am looking to train up my skills for then! 
I am really excited to be back working in Python after so long. For work I was primarily in the C# and .Net space so I did not have much exposure
to Python aside from my personal projects.

I decided that I want to make a personal finance application that will allow users to create simple budgets and savings goals. To do this I am 
learning about tkinter. I ran into some initial problems early with some MacOs system errors that I still havent resolved completely but I do 
have a working login form application that I can expand upon and hopefully the error will resolve itself...

For tomorrow I am hoping to start in on the personal finance project itself and get some meaningful work done on it. I will push that to github
to help document my learning. I am really excited for the upcoming days and cannot wait to see what the future holds!
